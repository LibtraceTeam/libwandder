Version 2.0.2
  * Fix encoding bug for UTCTime fields.

Version 2.0.1
=============
  * Add decoding support for ETSI LI HI1 Operation messages

Version 2.0.0
=============
  * Re-engineered BER encoding API. The BER API has almost completely
    changed from the original experimental version in 1.2.0 -- apologies
    to any users who were already using that API.
  * Added ability to encode and decode UTCTime data type.
  * Added BER encoding support for all ETSI LI record types (at least the
    ones that we already supported with DER).
  * wandder_get_valuestr() no longer accepts NULL as a valid value for
    the 'space' argument.

Version 1.2.0
=============
 * Added experimental support for encoding using BER, with fixed-length
   integer fields that allow for easier templating of encoded records to
   improve encoding performance.
 * Updated decoder to properly decode indefinite-length fields.
 * Added API functions for BER-encoding specific ETSI-LI message types
   into libwandder_etsili.h.
 * Added support for encoding and decoding UTCTime fields.
 * Added decode support for the UMTSCC and UMTSIRI ETSI-LI records
   produced by OpenLI.

Version 1.1.3
=============
Decoding:
 * Fixed bug that was causing wandder_etsili_get_cin() to return bogus
   values.

Version 1.1.2
=============
Encoding:
 * Fix bad memory accesses when encoding IP packets larger than 512 bytes.

Version 1.1.1
=============
Encoding:
 * Fix bug where NULL elements were not being included in encoded messages

Version 1.1.0
=============

Decoding:
 * Added new API function to access ETSI CIN: wandder_etsili_get_cin()
 * Added new API function to skip an encoded structure, including all of
   its children: wandder_decode_skip()
 * Add support for decoding ETSI LI microsecondTimestamp structures.
 * Cache results of decoding fields so that subsequent searches do not
   have to decode the same fields again.
 * Improve ETSI LI decoder performance by avoiding decoding contents of
   structures that we know won't contain the field we are looking for.
 * Improve generalizedTS decoding performance.

Encoding:
 * Fix bug where sIPContents ETSI LI fields were encoded as a string rather
   than an "IP" packet.
 * Add API to allow users to create "pre-encoded" fields for constant data
   values. The encoder then substitutes in the pre-encoded value directly
   rather than re-encoding the value every single time it appears in an
   encoded record.
 * Replace recursive functions with iterative equivalents to minimise
   function call overhead.
 * Improved encoding performance for integer values.
 * Improved encoding performance for single-byte identifiers.
 * Numerous other performance enhancements.

Other:
 * Added specific configure check for libpthread to ensure that code that
   links against us knows that libpthread is required.


Version 1.0.0
