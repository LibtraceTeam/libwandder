Version 1.1.1
=============
Encoding:
 * Fix bug where NULL elements were not being included in encoded messages

Version 1.1.0
=============

Decoding:
 * Added new API function to access ETSI CIN: wandder_etsili_get_cin()
 * Added new API function to skip an encoded structure, including all of
   its children: wandder_decode_skip()
 * Add support for decoding ETSI LI microsecondTimestamp structures.
 * Cache results of decoding fields so that subsequent searches do not
   have to decode the same fields again.
 * Improve ETSI LI decoder performance by avoiding decoding contents of
   structures that we know won't contain the field we are looking for.
 * Improve generalizedTS decoding performance.

Encoding:
 * Fix bug where sIPContents ETSI LI fields were encoded as a string rather
   than an "IP" packet.
 * Add API to allow users to create "pre-encoded" fields for constant data
   values. The encoder then substitutes in the pre-encoded value directly
   rather than re-encoding the value every single time it appears in an
   encoded record.
 * Replace recursive functions with iterative equivalents to minimise
   function call overhead.
 * Improved encoding performance for integer values.
 * Improved encoding performance for single-byte identifiers.
 * Numerous other performance enhancements.

Other:
 * Added specific configure check for libpthread to ensure that code that
   links against us knows that libpthread is required.
